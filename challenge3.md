   Write a program that asks the user for their favorite tea. If they choose "Oolong," print a message saying, "You have excellent taste!"

2. **Challenge 2: If-Else Statement**\
   Create a program that asks the user for their age. If the user is older than 18, allow them to proceed with purchasing tea; otherwise, print a message saying they are too young to purchase.

3. **Challenge 3: Nested If-Else**\
   Write a program that checks the temperature of tea water input by the user:

- If the temperature is above 100°C, print "Too hot!"
- If the temperature is between 80°C and 100°C, print "Perfect temperature."
- If the temperature is below 80°C, print "Too cold!"

4. **Challenge 4: Switch Case**\
